# Developing a prototype REST-API for managing todo lists

This project contains a simple implementation of a flask server developed with the aim to manage todo lists.
The API is capable of managing todo lists, its entries and users.

In terms of brevity and simplicity, there is no GUI. The server can therefore only be tested by using tools like Postman.
The file openapi.json holds the API specification; implementation can be found in todo_server-py.
